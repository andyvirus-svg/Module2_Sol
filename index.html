                <h2>Pani-Puri</h2>
                <p style="color: black;">
                    Pani Puri was reportedly first introduced in the ancient Kingdom of Magadha, which presides in the
                    Southern part of Bihar. Introduced during the 600 BC, Pani Puris were called Phulki in the Kingdom
                    of Magadha. According to a media report, during the ancient era, pani puris used to be much smaller,
                    crispier than those of today. However, there are other media reports that claim that the street food
                    was introduced in the Mahabharata. A media report suggests that pani puri was reportedly introduced
                    by Draupadi, the wife of Pandavas, when she was challenged by her mother-in-law Kunti. Reportedly,
                    one fine day Kunti threw a challenge at Draupadi, asking her to make a meal out of some leftover
                    potato curry and a small amount of dough. Draupadi, who was married to the five Pandavas brothers,
                    ideated a new recipe, made from the dough and potato curry, which later won her praise and
                    appreciation from her mother-in-law Kunti, who also blessed the dish with immortality.

                <p style="color: black;">
                    The company originated in Switzerland in 1884, when Julius Maggi took over his father's mill. He
                    quickly became a pioneer of industrial food production, aiming to improve the nutritional intake of
                    worker families. Maggi was the first to bring protein-rich legume meals to the market, and followed
                    up with a ready-made soup based on legume meals in 1886. After that Julius Maggi introduced bouillon
                    concentrates, first in capsules, then in cubes. In 1897, Julius Maggi founded the company Maggi GmbH
                    in Singen, Germany.

                <h2>Vada Pav</h2>
                <p style="color: black;">
                    The most common theory of the vada pav's origin is that it was invented in the erstwhile
                    mill-heartland of Central Mumbai. The carbohydrate-rich snack catered to the mill workers of what
                    was then known as Girangaon. The combination of the potato dumpling (batata vada) placed inside a
                    pav quickly became popular in Girangaon and later the rest of Maharashtra. The favourite snacks in
                    Maharashtra, vada pav is claimed to be a part of the culture of Marathis.
